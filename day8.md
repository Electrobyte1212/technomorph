# üöÄ Technomorph ‚Äì Day 8: Project Implementation and Documentation



## üìù Overview
Day 8 marked the final phase of the Technomorph training, focused on **project implementation, documentation, and hackathon preparation**. It was a team-based session where we applied everything we learned‚Äîsensors, microcontrollers, motors, wireless communication, and design‚Äîto build a working prototype.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Team-Based Project Build with ESP32 and Arduino Components
- Collaborated in teams to brainstorm and build final robotics projects
- Used components like ESP32, Arduino Uno, sensors, motors, and 3D-printed parts
- Followed a goal-driven approach from concept to functional model

### 2. Structured Documentation: Code, Diagrams, Testing Logs
- Maintained clean and well-commented Arduino/ESP32 code
- Created wiring diagrams using tools like Tinkercad and Fritzing
- Logged testing results, performance data, and debugging notes

### 3. System Integration and Debugging
- Assembled hardware and integrated all subsystems: power, sensors, motors, logic
- Used serial monitor, multimeters, and real-time testing for debugging
- Identified and fixed hardware-software mismatches and logical errors

### 4. Writing Final Reports and Project Wiki Pages
- Created detailed project documentation for submission:
  - Project objective and description
  - List of components used
  - Circuit diagram and hardware layout
  - Source code and test results
- Organized content into GitHub wiki or PDF report format

### 5. Submission and Readiness Brief for TechnoMorph Hackathon
- Final project demos were prepared for presentation
- Submitted complete documentation and project materials
- Discussed expectations and evaluation criteria for the upcoming Technomorph Hackathon

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
Day 8 wrapped up our training with a full-cycle project build, from idea to implementation and documentation. It was exciting to apply all our technical knowledge and creativity in a real project. We're now ready to showcase our work and compete in the **Technomorph Hackathon**.
