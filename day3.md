# ü§ñ Technomorph ‚Äì Day 3: Sensors and Real-World Applications



## üìù Overview
Day 3 of the Technomorph robotics training focused on sensors‚Äîcrucial components that allow robots to sense and respond to their environment. The session included both theoretical learning and hands-on practice with real sensors.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Sensor Fundamentals and Types
- Introduction to what sensors are and how they work
- Types of sensors: IR, ultrasonic, temperature, light, proximity, etc.
- Difference between active and passive sensors

### 2. Hands-on with IR and Ultrasonic Sensors
- Wiring and testing IR and ultrasonic sensors
- Distance measurement using ultrasonic sensors
- Object detection using IR sensors

### 3. Analog vs. Digital Sensor Data Handling
- Analog sensors provide a range of values (0‚Äì1023)
- Digital sensors provide binary values (HIGH/LOW)
- Used Arduino functions like `analogRead()` and `digitalRead()`

### 4. Sensor Interfacing Techniques
- Understanding signal pins, power supply, and ground
- Use of pull-up and pull-down resistors
- Troubleshooting common circuit issues

### 5. Practical Applications
- Obstacle detection systems
- Automated door systems
- Smart robotics with sensor integration

### 6. Recording Sensor Data and Validation Reports
- Used Arduino Serial Monitor to observe live sensor data
- Recorded and interpreted values
- Understood importance of data accuracy and validation

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
Day 3 helped us connect theory to real-world applications by learning how sensors work and how to integrate them into circuits. It was exciting to see how small electronic components can bring robotic systems to life.
