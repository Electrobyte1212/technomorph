# ðŸ¤– Technomorph â€“ Robotics Training

**Technomorph** is a hands-on robotics training program designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of robotics, electronics, and embedded systems. Throughout the training, we explore concepts like microcontrollers, Arduino programming, circuit design, and real-world applications of robotics.

This repository contains notes, documentation, and project files from my journey through the Technomorph training sessions.

## Topics Covered
- History and Evolution of Robotics  
- Types and Classification of Robots  
- Introduction to Microcontrollers and Arduino  
- Arduino IDE Setup and Basic Programming  
- Circuit Simulation using Tinkercad

Stay tuned for project updates and more as the training progresses!
