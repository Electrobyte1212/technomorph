# üõ†Ô∏è Technomorph ‚Äì Day 7: Product Design and 3D Printing


## üìù Overview
Day 7 marked the final stage of the Technomorph robotics training, focusing on **product design and prototyping using 3D printing**. We explored how to transform an idea into a physical robotic component through structured design processes and rapid prototyping techniques.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Design Thinking Process
- Introduction to the five stages of design thinking: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test
- How design thinking helps solve real-world robotics problems
- Emphasis on user-centered and iterative development

### 2. Mechanical Design Fundamentals
- Basics of designing physical structures for robotic systems
- Considerations for strength, weight, material, and motion
- Understanding tolerances and clearances in 3D design

### 3. 3D Printing with Available PLA Material
- Overview of PLA (Polylactic Acid) material and its benefits
- Steps to prepare a model for 3D printing: slicing, leveling, and loading
- Safety guidelines and printer operation basics

### 4. Mechanical Design for Available Components
- Designing around real-world constraints (motor sizes, screws, sensors)
- Creating housings, brackets, and frames suitable for robotics components
- Modifying and adapting existing designs for custom use

### 5. CAD Software Introduction
- Introduction to CAD tools like Tinkercad and Fusion 360
- Hands-on practice in creating simple 3D models
- Exporting STL files for slicing and printing

### 6. Rapid Prototyping Workflow
- Complete flow: sketch ‚Üí CAD model ‚Üí slice ‚Üí print ‚Üí test ‚Üí iterate
- Integrating 3D-printed parts into electronic and robotic systems
- Importance of prototyping for innovation and debugging

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
Day 7 gave us the tools to bring our robotics ideas into the physical world. By learning design thinking and 3D printing, we now have the ability to create functional, customized parts that fit real components. This session completed our journey from concept to working prototype.
