# üîã Technomorph ‚Äì Day 5: Power Management Systems



## üìù Overview
On Day 5 of the Technomorph robotics training, we focused on one of the most critical aspects of any robotic system ‚Äî **Power Management**. A reliable and efficient power supply is essential for the stability, performance, and safety of robotics applications. The session introduced us to battery technologies, distribution systems, and safety mechanisms.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Power System Fundamentals
- Importance of power management in robotics
- Basics of voltage, current, resistance, and power ratings
- Understanding power requirements of different components (microcontrollers, motors, sensors)

### 2. Li-Po / Li-ion Battery Systems
- Introduction to Lithium Polymer (Li-Po) and Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) batteries
- Advantages and disadvantages of each
- Proper handling, charging, and storage guidelines

### 3. Power Distribution for Available Components
- Techniques for powering multiple modules from a single power source
- Understanding current draw and power budgeting
- Use of power rails and connectors on breadboards and PCBs

### 4. Power Distribution and Regulation
- Using voltage regulators (e.g., 7805, AMS1117) to manage output voltage
- Step-up and step-down (buck/boost) converters
- Preventing over-voltage or under-voltage damage

### 5. Power Management Strategies
- Efficient power usage to extend battery life
- Switching between battery and USB power
- Using sleep modes in microcontrollers to save power

### 6. Safety and Protection Systems
- Importance of fuses, thermal cutoffs, and protection circuits
- Identifying battery swelling, overcharge, and short-circuit risks
- Best practices for safe project wiring and power supply integration

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
Day 5 gave us a deep understanding of how to safely and efficiently power our robotics projects. With the right power management techniques, we can ensure consistent performance, longer run times, and safe operation of our systems. This knowledge is essential as we move toward building complete, autonomous robots.
