# ü§ñ Technomorph ‚Äì Day 4: Wired Communication and Actuators



## üìù Overview
Day 4 of the Technomorph robotics training focused on two essential components of robotics systems: **communication protocols** and **actuators**. We explored how motors are controlled using microcontrollers and how signals are sent through wired communication methods.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Communication Protocols
- Introduction to wired communication techniques used in robotics
- Common protocols: UART, I2C, and SPI (overview)
- Applications of serial communication between Arduino and external devices

### 2. Available Actuators and Motors
- Overview of different actuators used in robotics:
  - DC motors
  - Servo motors
  - Stepper motors
- Comparison based on precision, speed, torque, and control method

### 3. Motor Control with Arduino UNO
- Practical session on controlling DC and servo motors with Arduino
- Learned about H-Bridge motor drivers (e.g., L298N module)
- Writing Arduino code to rotate motors in both directions

### 4. Signal Modulation: PWM Control
- Introduction to Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
- How PWM is used to control motor speed and servo angles
- Used `analogWrite()` to control motor speed on PWM-enabled pins

### 5. Wired Communication Implementation
- Hands-on implementation of serial communication using `Serial.begin()`, `Serial.print()`, and `Serial.read()`
- Sending and receiving data between Arduino and computer
- Real-time motor control via serial input

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
Day 4 helped us understand how robotic systems move and communicate. Learning about motors and PWM gave us direct control over motion, while wired communication laid the foundation for future integration with sensors, displays, or other microcontrollers.
